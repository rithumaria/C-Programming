# C++ Programming

## INTRODUCTION

C++ is one of the most popular programming languages.It is based on C, but it is an object-oriented programming language.It is widely used in graphics, libraries, games, network devices,etc.This tutorial will guide you to setup and compile a C++ Progrm.

### Why should we learn C++?
#### Features of C++
* C++ is fast
* Easy to learn
* A powerful programming language
* Has many built-in functions and operators which can make complex programs easy
* Can be compiled on a number of computer platforms
* C++ is an object-oriented programming language
* Use of pointer makes it a much more powerful language
* Also largely used in many large-scale projects

### C++ Compiler Installations on Windows
To use C++ compiler in Windows, you can install any one software mentioned below:
* You can **download a 90-day version of Visual Studio** 
* You can download **Dev-C++ IDE** to develop C and C++ application.
* You can install **MinGW**

### How to start?
In this whole C++ tutorial, you will be learning about writing C++ programs.But what after that?

After writing any program, we need to **compile** and **run** it to see the output of the program.

So, what is meant by compiling?

When we write our program in C++ language, it needs to be converted to machine language (which is binary language consisting of 0s and 1s) so that computer can understand and execute it. This conversion is known as compiling a program.We compile a code with the help of a **compiler**.

### Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
To write and compile our C++ program, we have been provided with many IDEs.

An IDE consists of a **Text Editor** as well as a **Compiler**.We type our program in the text editor which is then compiled by the compiler.
* **Text Editor**:
We write our program in a text editor.The file containing our program is called **source file** and is saved with a **.cpp** extension.
* **C++ Compiler**:
After saving our program in a file with the .cpp extension, we need to compile it to convert it into machine language that computer can understand.
Now let's see how to compile and execute a C++ program on different operation systems.

### Writing and compiling C++ program on Windows
Though there are many IDE's available for editing and compiling C++ programs for Windows, here we are talking about editing and compiling program using **DevC++** which allows us to edit, compile and run our program.We can write and save our program using DevC++ itself and then compile it using the same.

Before learning to write a program in DevC++, first, make sure it is installed in your computer.If not, then download and install it.

To write and compile in DevC++, follow the steps given below:-

1. On opening DevC++, you will get a window. Click on File->New->Source File option

2. Write your C++ program as shown below and save it (**ctrl+s**).
```
#include<iostream.h>

int main()

{

  std::cout<<"Hello World"<<std::endl;
  
  return();
  
}
```
3. Onceyou have written the program, click on compile and run.

4. An output window will appear showing the result, i.e, **Hello World** printed.

Now you can start practising with simple codes.

Happy Coding!:heart:
